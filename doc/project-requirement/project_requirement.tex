        \large A Book Reading and Review Web Application}

\begin{document}

  \maketitle
        \section{Project Overview}
        \subsection{Application Overview}
        Our team will be developing a database application where users can find free books and are able to download them via multiple formats and leave reviews on those books for other customers to see. The books that the user can see will be ranging from textbooks to novels. A user will be given the option to create an account, or if they already registered, login to their account. After this, the user will be able to search for a specific book, whether that is by the title of the book or its ISBN number. If the user does not know the specific book they want to find, they can search for a specific author, or genre. Searches will include various filtering options such as date published, publisher, book length, user favorites, etc. Users can sort search results by the title alphabetically, the author alphabetically, or by book rating.

\medskip
        In our application, users will be able to leave reviews on books that they have read, which will be seen by other users and possibly influence their decision on their book. These reviews will contain both a comment section and a star rating system. Users will be able to comment how they either liked or disliked the book and give a star rating from one to five. The average star rating and total number of reviews will be displayed next to the book. Users will also be able to share the book they like with others with a shareable link that they can distribute how they please.
        \subsection{Stakeholders and Importance}
        The stakeholders of our applications will be students who want to find free textbook alternative to the paid bookstore alternative, as well as casual and dedicated book readers who can find free books online and download them for instant reading. This application is important because it provides a streamlined way for book-readers to gain easy access to the books they want and get them in a timely manner


	\section{System Environment}
	
			\includegraphics[scale=.66]{3-tier.png}
			\subsection{Presentation Layer}
			\begin{itemize}
			 \item HTML
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Purpose: HTML is the markup language supported by all major web-browsers. It allows content to be presented to a readable manner to the end-user. We will take advantage of HTML formatting tools such as hyperlinks, tables, and lists. Further, we will be using HTML forms for user input of email, username, password, search boxes, and comments.
					\item Version: HTML 5
				\end{itemize}
			\item Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
			\begin{itemize}	
				\item Purpose: CSS will be used to improve the user experience of our web application. CSS gives us the ability to make animations, colored content, as well as more control of the appearance of our content.
				\item Version: CSS 3
			\end{itemize}
			\item	JavaScript (Client Side):
				\begin{itemize}
					\item	Purpose: Provide interactivity such as collection of user input, improve visual responsiveness, and sending alerts to users.
					\item Version: ECMA2016
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Application Layer}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Web Server: Node.js HTTP Module
			
				-Version: 10.6.3 LTS
			
			\item Server Side Application Language: JavaScript
				
				-Purpose: Provide communition between the presentation layer and the database layer
				-Version: EMCAScript2016

			\item	NPM Package Manger:

				-Purpose: Provide easy managment of external Node.js libraries such as express js, sql module, connect module, and http module.

				-Version: 6.9.0 
		\end{itemize}	
		\subsection{Data Layer}
		
			\begin{itemize}
			
			\item	This web application will require the use of a relational database management system (RDBMS), the specific RDBMS we will use is  MySQL.
			\item We will take advantage of the SQL programming language for tasks such as data definition, manipulation, query, control,and transaction control.
			\item MySQL RDBMS will take care of concurrency control, and will maintain the ACID principle for our database. 
			\item MySQL Version: 5.7.27
			\item Query Language: SQL
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Hardware/ Software Used}
		
		\begin{itemize}

			\item Client Software Requirements
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A web browser supporting the following is required to run the web application:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item ECMAScript2016
						\item HTML5
						\item CSS3
					\end{itemize}
			\item Since the 3-tier architecture will only be virtual, (no remote web server or DMBS), the client will be required to install the proper versions of Node.js as well as MySQL as specified. 
			
			\item  MySQL and Node.js are available on many operating systemssuch as Linux, MacOS, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD	
			\end{itemize}

		\item Client Hardware Requirements:
			\begin{itemize}	
				\item Any hardware with support by the above software will be sufficient to run the web application.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}


\section{Functional Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}

	\item	Search Book:
			-Users can search for books by ISBN, author, or title
	\item	Order Search Results:
			-User can order the search results based on relese date or number of favorites. Default search behavior is based on the number of favorites a book has received

	\item	Filter Search Results:
			-User can filter the search reslts based on author, title, release date, publisher, or genre
	\item	Select Book:
			-Once user finds the desired book, they can select the book and view its profile.

		-Users will be able to log out by clicking the "Log Out" button on the top right corner of the webpage.

	
	\end{itemize}	
		
		
	\section{Non-Functional Issues}

		\subsection{Graphical User Interace}
			The Graphical interface of the sytem will have the following qualities: attractivness, usability, and responsivness
			\subsubsection{Attractivness}
				The GUI will have a color palate which makes the system attractive to users. We will use high quality fonts and images where appliciple. The GUI as a whole will have a coherent and consistent theme. 
			\subsubsection{Usability}
				The GUI will be intuitive. Users will not have to read documenation on how to use the system in order to use it. Options availible to the user will be kept to a minimum as to encourage simplicity.
			\subsubsection{Responsiveness}
				Users will be aware that their requests have been recorded. For example, a user clicks a button, there will be an indication that the button has been successfully clicked, such as a change in color. We will keep bloat to a minimum, such as animations and videos, as to encourage responsiveness for older hardware.

		\subsection{Security}
			\subsubsection{User Security}
				To protect user data and privacy, users entities will have the following attributes:
				\begin{itemize}
						\item A unique username
						\item A password, required to follow the minimum standards set by the system: which is a minimum of 8 characters, 1 uppercase character, 1 lowercase character, 1 numerical character, and 1 special character
				\end{itemize}

			\subsubsection{SQL injection protection}
				To protect form SQL injections, we will take precautions to inspect all user input and escape any characters which could breach security.

		\subsection{Access Control}

			\subsubsection{Types of Users}
				\begin{itemize}
		
					\item \textbf{User}
						

						Users will only have read access to the following:
						\begin{itemize}
							\item  Their own personal data
							\item  Book repositories
						\end{itemize}


					 In addition, users will have write access to the following:
						\begin{itemize}
							\item  Their favorites list
							\item  Reviews left for books
						\end{itemize}

					\item \textbf{Administrator}

						Administrators have access \textbf{all user functionality} plus extra permissions to data which is not available to the general public. DB admins have read/write access to the following: 			\begin{itemize}
				\item User details such as name and email, and
				\item Book repositories
		  \end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
