	\section{Project Overview}
	\subsection{Application Overview}
	Our team will be developing a database application where users can find free books and are able to download them via multiple formats and leave reviews on those books for other customers to see. The books that the user can see will be ranging from textbooks to novels. A user will be given the option to create an account, or if they already registered, login to their account. After this, the user will be able to search for a specific book, whether that by the title of the book or its ISBN number. If the user does not know the specific book they want to find, they can search for a specific author, or genre. Searches will include filtering options by the first letter of the book title, the first letter of the author, or by the user's favorites. Users can sort search results alphabetically by sorting by the title alphabetically, the author alphabetically, and by book rating.


	In our application, users will be able to leave reviews on books that they have read, which will be seen by other users and possibly influence their decision on their book. These reviews will contain both a comment section and a star rating system. Users will be able to comment how they either liked or disliked the book and give a star rating from one to five. The average star rating and total number of reviews will be displayed next to the book.
	\subsection{Stakeholders and Importnace}
	The stakeholders of our applications will be students who want to find free textbook alternative to the paid bookstore alternative, as well as casual and dedicated book readers who can find free books online and download them for instant reading. The
