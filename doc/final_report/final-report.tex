\section{Part I | Project Requirements}
\subsection{Project Description}
\subsubsection{Application Overview}
Our team will be developing a database application where users can find free books and are able to download them via multiple formats and leave reviews on those books for other customers to see. The books that the user can see will be ranging from textbooks to novels. A user will be given the option to create an account, or if they already registered, login to their account. After this, the user will be able to search for a specific book, whether that is by the title of the book or its ISBN number. If the user does not know the specific book they want to find, they can search for a specific author, or genre. Searches will include various filtering options such as date published, publisher, book length, user favorites, etc. Users can sort search results by the title alphabetically, the author alphabetically, or by book rating.

\medskip
In our application, users will be able to leave reviews on books that they have read, which will be seen by other users and possibly influence their decision on their book. These reviews will contain both a comment subsection and a star rating system. Users will be able to comment how they either liked or disliked the book and give a star rating from one to five. The average star rating and total number of reviews will be displayed next to the book. Users will also be able to share the book they like with others with a shareable link that they can distribute how they please.
\subsubsection{Project Motivation}
The motivation behind this project is that as college students, we find ourselves paying several hundreds of dollars on college textbooks alone every semester, only to have them sitting on a shelf afterwards not being opened. Those hundreds of dollars spent on semester long textbooks could have been better utilized for students on other needs such as groceries or rent. We want to make a website to give students that option, giving them a website where they can download their desired textbooks for free.
\subsubsection{Project Goal}
The Goal of this project is to provide a free and open source infrastructure where users can read books from the public domain. We wish to provide an easy-to-use ecosystem, which allows the user to read or review books with ease.
\subsubsection{Benefits to Users}
Users will have a community where they can \textbf{read and review books for free}. Right now, websites such as this exists, but they only serve one of the two desired functionalities. Websites like gutenberg.org give the users access to free book repositories, but do not allow for users to read and write reviews on books. Conversely, websites like bookpage.com provide reviews for books, but they do not provide free access to such books. Our web application will take the best aspects of both these websites to provide the user an efficient solution for picking and reading online books for free.
\subsubsection{Stakeholders and Importance}
The stakeholders of our applications will be students who want to find free textbook alternative to the paid bookstore alternative, as well as casual and dedicated book readers who can find free books online and download them for instant reading. This application is important because it provides a streamlined way for book-readers to gain easy access to the books they want and get them in a timely manner.


\subsection{System Environment}

\includegraphics[scale=.66]{3-tier.png}
\subsubsection{Presentation Layer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item HTML
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Purpose: HTML is the markup language supported by all major web-browsers. It allows content to be presented to a readable manner to the end-user. We will take advantage of HTML formatting tools such as hyperlinks, tables, and lists. Further, we will be using HTML forms for user input of email, username, password, search boxes, and comments.
		      \item Version: HTML 5
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Purpose: CSS will be used to improve the user experience of our web application. CSS gives us the ability to make animations, colored content, as well as more control of the appearance of our content.
		      \item Version: CSS 3
		      \item Framework: Bootstrap
	      \end{itemize}
	\item	JavaScript (Client Side):
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item	Purpose: Provide interactivity such as collection of user input, improve visual responsiveness, and sending alerts to users.
		      \item Version: ECMA2016
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application Layer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Web Server: Node.js HTTP Module

	      -Version: 10.6.3 LTS

	\item Server Side Application Language: JavaScript

	      -Purpose: Provide commination between the presentation layer and the database layer
	      -Version: EMCAScript 2016

	\item	NPM Package Manger:

	      -Purpose: Provide easy managment of external Node.js libraries such as express js, sql module, connect module, and http module.

	      -Version: 6.9.0
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Data Layer}

\begin{itemize}

	\item	This web application will require the use of a relational database management system (RDBMS), the specific RDBMS we will use is  MySQL.
	\item We will take advantage of the SQL programming language for tasks such as data definition, manipulation, query, control,and transaction control.
	\item MySQL RDBMS will take care of concurrency control, and will maintain the ACID principle for our database.
	\item MySQL Version: 5.7.27
	\item Query Language: SQL
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hardware/ Software Used}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Client Software Requirements
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item A web browser supporting the following is required to run the web application:
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item ECMAScript2016
			            \item HTML5
			            \item CSS3
		            \end{itemize}
		      \item Since the 3-tier architecture will only be virtual, (no remote web server or DMBS), the client will be required to install the proper versions of Node.js as well as MySQL as specified.

		      \item  MySQL and Node.js are available on many operating systems such as Linux, MacOS, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Client Hardware Requirements:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Any hardware with support by the above software will be sufficient to run the web application.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Because this application is to be accessed from a web browser, the \textbf{input} is a keyboard or mouse, while the \textbf{output} is stylized HTML to be displayed on a web browser.

\subsection{Non-Functional Issues}

\subsubsection{Graphical User Interface}
The Graphical interface of the system will have the following qualities: attractiveness, usability, and responsiveness
\subparagraph{Attractiveness}
The GUI will have a color palate which makes the system attractive to users. We will use high quality fonts and images where applicable. The GUI as a whole will have a coherent and consistent theme.
\subparagraph{Usability}
The GUI will be intuitive. Users will not have to read documentation on how to use the system in order to use it. Options available to the user will be kept to a minimum as to encourage simplicity.
\subparagraph{Responsiveness}
Users will be aware that their requests have been recorded. For example, a user clicks a button, there will be an indication that the button has been successfully clicked, such as a change in color. We will keep bloat to a minimum, such as animations and videos, as to encourage responsiveness for older hardware.

\subsubsection{Security}
\subparagraph{User Security}
To protect user data and privacy, users entities will have the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A unique username
	\item A password, required to follow the minimum standards set by the system: which is a minimum of 8 characters, 1 uppercase character, 1 lowercase character, 1 numerical character, and 1 special character
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{SQL Injection Protection}
To protect form SQL injections, we will take precautions to inspect all user input and escape any characters which could breach security.

\subparagraph{Encryption}
Any sensitive information collected from users will be encrypted fields in the relational database. All passwords will be hashed and we will take advantage of MySQL's build in password functionality.

\subparagraph{Anonymity}
When a user makes a comment, \textbf{only their username will show up}, not their real name. Anonymity protects users from being identified against their will, and prevents personal attacks or blackmail. Users on this web application should be allowed to enjoy and review any books they like, and not have to be worried about ramifications.

\subsubsection{Concurrency Control}
The Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), MySQL, will take care of all needs relating to concurrency control. From the user's perspective, all transactions can be made concurrently.

\subsubsection{Access Control}

\subparagraph{Types of Users}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User}
	      this type of accounts are registered by user themselves


	      Users will only have read access to the following:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item  Their own account profile
		      \item  Book repositories with open access
	      \end{itemize}


	      In addition, users will have write access to the following:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item  Their own account profile information
		      \item  Their favorites list
		      \item  Reviews left for books under restrictions
	      \end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Database Administrator}
	      this type of accounts are created assigned by the system owners


	      Database Administrators have access \textbf{all user functionality} plus extra permissions to data which is not available to the general public. DB admins have read/write access to the following:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Read user profile
		      \item Modify user profile including password with authentication from user
		      \item Add and delete book repositories
		      \item Delete comments by users that are not under restrictions
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF) Proofs}
\subsubsection{Users | BCNF Proof }


\textit{Claim: the Users relation is in BCNF}


\begin{proof}


	The relational schema for for the \textbf{Users} table is:


	$ Users(user\_id, user\_type, username) $


	The minimal cover of the functional dependencies for Users is:


	$ user\_id \rightarrow user\_type, username $


	Now, we have to check if $user\_id$ is a superkey, because it is the left side of our only functional dependency.


	Computing the closure of $user\_id$, we find that...

	$user\_id+ = \{user\_id, username, user\_type\}$

	Which means that $user\_id$ is a superkey, so the only non-trivial functional dependency in the minimal cover of FDs for this relation does \textbf{not} violate BCNF

	$\therefore Users \in BCNF $
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Reviews | BCNF Proof }


\textit{Claim: the Reviews relation is in BCNF}


\begin{proof}


	The relational schema for for the \textbf{Reviews} table is:


	$Reviews(user\_id, content\_id, user\_comment, rating)$


	The minimal cover of the functional dependencies for Reviews is:


	$ user\_id, content\_id \rightarrow user\_comment, rating $


	Now, we have to check if the set of attributes  $\{user\_id, content\_id\}$ is a superkey, because it is the left side of our only functional dependency.


	Computing the closure of $\{user\_id, content\_id\}$, we find that...

	$\{user\_id, content\_id\}+ = \{user\_id, content\_id, user\_comment, rating\} $

	Which means that $\{user\_id, content\_id\}$ is a superkey, so the only non-trivial functional dependency in the minimal cover of FDs for this relation does \textbf{not} violate BCNF

	$\therefore Reviews \in BCNF $
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Favorites | BCNF Proof }



\textit{Claim: the Favorites relation is in BCNF}


\begin{proof}


	The relational schema for for the \textbf{Favorites} table is:

	$Favorites(user\_id, content\_id)$

	There are no non-trival Functional Dependencies in this relation, so it is true that for all non-trivial FD's $\in$ Favorites (none), the left side of the FD is a superkey.

	$\therefore Favorites \in BCNF $


\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Downloads | BCNF Proof }


\textit{Claim: the Downloads relation is in BCNF}


\begin{proof}

	The relational schema for for the \textbf{Downloads} table is:

	$Downloads(user\_id, content\_id)$

	There are no non-trival Functional Dependencies in this relation, so it is true that for all non-trivial FD's $\in$ Downloads (none), the left side of the FD is a superkey.

	$\therefore Downloads \in BCNF $

\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Poem | BCNF Proof }

\begin{proof}


	The relational schema for for the \textbf{Poem} table is:


	$Poem(content\_id, poem\_type, author)$


	The minimal cover of the functional dependencies is:


	$ content\_id \rightarrow poem\_type, rating $


	Now, we have to check if the attribute $content\_id$ is a superkey, because it is the left side of our only functional dependency.


	Computing the closure of $\{content\_id\}$, we find that...

	$\{content\_id\}+ = \{content\_id, author, poem\_type \} $

	Which means that $\{content\_id\}$ is a superkey, so the only non-trivial functional dependency in the minimal cover of FDs for this relation does \textbf{not} violate BCNF

	$\therefore Poem \in BCNF $
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Content | BCNF Proof }

\begin{proof}


	The relational schema for for the \textbf{Content} table is:


	$Content(content\_id, content\_type, title, date\_published)$


	The minimal cover of the functional dependencies is:


	$ content\_id \rightarrow content\_type, title, date\_published $


	Now, we have to check if the attribute $content\_id$ is a superkey, because it is the left side of our only functional dependency.


	Computing the closure of $\{content\_id\}$, we find that...

	$\{content\_id\}+ = \{content\_id, content\_type, title, date\_published  \} $

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Implementation Overview}
	On the server, our project uses the Node.js runtime environment and express.js framework for routing and  http requests/ responses. Each HTML page is implemented using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as a templating engine. 

	Here is a general overview of how the application works:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The server is initialized, this includes:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Claiming the 8080 port of local host using express.js | app.listen()
				\item Establishing a database connection, using the Node.js MySQL module 
					
					| mysql.createConnection(JSON obj)
				\item Defining where all static content is located  (files, photos, etc), using express.js
					
					| express.static(/path/to/static/content)
				\item Initializing all routes/ modules, such as content, auth, and search
			\end{itemize}
		\item HTTP requests from the client trigger various database operations such as INSERT and SELECT, which are executing using the MySQL module function database.query(string sql\_code, function callback). Database.query() is an asynchronous function, meaning that there is no guarantee that it will be executed immediately upon calling it. For this reason, we often must wrap our server HTTP responses in the callback function, assuming we want to use data in our webpages which we have just queried.
		\item Dynamic content queried from the database is then served using EJS templates.
			EJS allows us to embed server-like JavaScript code into our HTML code. 
			The templating engine then truncates the js/HTML hybrid into proper HTML code for the browser to parse.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Project Conclusion}

\subsection{Lessons from Project | Teammate Statements}

\subsubsection{Brett Dispoto}
Prior to working on OpenBooks, I had no knowledge of practical database design/ application development. I now understand the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The importance of an E/R design and analysis \textbf{prior} to implementing the relational schemas in the DBMS. Because our group put a large amount of work into our relational schema design, the normalization process into BCNF was extremely minimal.
	\item How to perform database integration on a virtualised 3-tier architecture. This includes
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item How to install and configure a local MySQL server, allowing remote access.
		      \item How to use Node.js to perform MySQL database queries, then parsing the JSON output of those queries.
		      \item How to install and configure the MySQL Node.js module.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item How to use embedded javascript (EJS) to display dynamically generated content using data from a MySQL database.
	\item How to write SQL (DDL/DML) scripts for automated database setup.
	\item How to effectively work as a team, where the responsibilities include writing functional specifications,  designing database schemas, and implementing a database application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Improvements | Discussion}
A \textit{wishlist} of future improvements for this project would be as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Deploying the database/ middleware on a remote server, eliminating the virtualised 3-tier architecture we are currently running on in favor of a proper client-server-database architecture. This would allow OpenBooks to be accessed on the web, rather than having to manually install, configure, and deploy on the client's local machine.
	\item Adding advertisements | the data stored in our tables would be valuable to advertising firms running targeted advertisements. Information such as \textit{"John Doe likes to read the new york times on Tuesday afternoons"} is very useful to such firms, and the revenue gained could be used to help OpenBooks achieve  goal (1) above.
	\item Add more tables to track user data such as average session time.
	\item Add more features / customizability user profiles |  such as profile photos, following users, view other user's profile.
	\item Email notification system | When a new book is released by an author of which a user has favorited their book, the user should receive an email notification.
	\item Look into the possibility of having tables be 4NF/5NF.
	\item A terms of service, copyright licence, and privacy policy.
\end{enumerate}
